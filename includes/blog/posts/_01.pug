    p Thank you all the friends and co-workers who sent me messages and encouraged me to create Luxa CSS, and help me with the project!
    p It has been a very nice adventure and this crew only grows more and more to infinity and beyond!
    p Recently there has been a huge increase in visits here on the docs site, so I thought it would be a good time to start publishing a blog with project updates.
    h3 Why I created the framework?

        | Luxa CSS was born out of a need for me and my co-workers when I joined

    p Before, there was no standard for development. Thus, when another dev had to support a project he did not build, he wasted too much time to understand the development pattern of the responsible colleague.
    p So I started planning Luxa. I built a base version and it was quickly adopted. Since then I haven't stopped developing it.
    p In the Luxa CSS repository on Github, I say that is the first time I have ventured into something like this and that English is not my native language. So, since his creation, it has been a very enriching journey, as I have been in contact with many people, even from other countries and I have learned a lot! If you are reading this, I am already grateful for spending your time!
    h3 Project Roadmap

        | , and I have tried, within my capabilities and available time, to develop the project continuously.
    p In this post I want to talk about some issues, resources, components and changes coming to the short term future and also some of the long term plans.
    h5 - Forms
    p Yes, forms, sources of many headaches even for experienced devs!
    p The goal here is to unify the initial look between browsers and common field types, almost like a reset, with a minimum of customization to look elegant.
    h5 - Colors
    p I have been studying a nice way to offer this feature for some time. As I had no prior knowledge, this feature was postponed.
    h5 - Documentation translation in other languages
    p Very important for accessibility, I initially thought of my native language (Brazilian Portuguese) and Hindi.
    blockquote If you want to contribute, this is a great way!
    h4 In a few light years?!
    p Themes, templates, video tutorials and snippets of Javascript code to copy, paste and thus add functionality (Luxa CSS is a framework focused on style only).
    p Moving forward in spacetime, I want to make Luxa CSS a tool to help you develop your projects in a simple, light and safe way!
