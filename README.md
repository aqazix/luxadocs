# Luxa CSS Docs

This repo is the docs site for the CSS framework called [Luxa CSS](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa).

## Luxa CSS

> Luxa CSS is a minimalist CSS framework.

Simple and focused, its goal is to provide a lightweight solution that can be easily implemented in any development context.

With simple class names like `.lx-btn` or `.lx-row`, and a simple modifier system, like `.is-left`.

See examples and projects in Codepen made using it, in [my profile](https://codepen.io/luxonauta).

I never did anything like that and English is not my native language, if there are any mistakes, please feel free to correct me, I will be very grateful!
